Bitcoin:
--------

1. Limited supply of 21 Million. Why limited supply ? To make sure the value of Bitcoin is maintained stable over time.

   no of bitcoins currently in use ~ 19 Million
   no of bitcoins generated will be halved for every 210,000 blocks or 4 years

a. Buying thru exchanges
b. Thru mining of bitcoins

 16 BTC - per block
  8 BTC - per block
  4 BTC - per block
  2 BTC - per block
  1 BTC - pe block

to mine all bitcoins from the protocol it would be around the year ~ 2140

6.25 ---- 2022
3.125 ---- 2026
1.85  - 2030

Binance:
--------
 1. Ethereum
 2. Bitocoin

configuration details: toconnect tonetwork

 Bitcoin - [10.60.45.120 to 10.60.44.165] -- generate pub, priv keys along with wallet address
 Ethereum - [10.15.56.16 to 10.15.45.135] -- EIP generate pub, priv keys along with wallet address



y = mx + c

account = random combination (public ky and private key)

3 tightly bound to ech other 

SHA 256 - one sich alogrithm --- which will crete these random 

RIPEMD160 - hash all these and create a fixed byte of account address


if we create multiple such accounts ---> it will generate multiple such priv, pub keys

wallet:

 1. accnt -- key1
 2. accnt -- key2

Command Line Terminals:
-------------------------

how does public and private keys re created ---

 1. name
 2. mail id
 3. mobile numer
 4. XYZ 

func Generatewallet (name, mail, mobile, xyz) 

 {

 retun pub, priv, wallet)

BTC follows UTXO model (unspent transaction output)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Purchased 10 BTC ---> 10 BTC ---     (input 10, output ix not calcuated bcz I've spent this unit)
2. Credit of 5 BTC from Aamir ----> 5 BTC (input is 5 BTC, output ix not calcuated bcz I've spent this unit)

I've to spend 2 BTC  to transfer to Sriram


account { 13 BTC }
        
         { 10 BTC CR  ---  unspent
            5 BTC CR ( 5 BTC , 2 BTC , usera , userb) ---- spent ---->
            3 BTC CR --- unspent
                     } 
         { 2BTC }
         we create blocks from multiple txns...MIners will have visibilty of the no of txn from a particular accnt.

        single block - us should be able to accept only 1 txn per account
         

1MB - 100 txns - Bitcoin --- 20-40 mins
1MB - 120 tnx


userb : 

1. credit if 2 BTC from usera --- unspent


100 CR
